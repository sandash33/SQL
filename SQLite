#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. Before each segment of code, is the question I was looking to answer.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS jan_orders 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS jan_iphone_orders 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
   
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT c.acctnum 
    FROM BIT_DB.customers c
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f 
    ON f.orderID = c.order_id;
    
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?     
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS janrevenue 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
    ON c.order_id = f.orderID
    WHERE f.quantity > 2;
    
 #8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
 SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
    GROUP BY product;
    
 #9. How many locations are there in New York that sold more than 1 product in January?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT location)
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE location LIKE '%NY%' 
    AND quantity > 1;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
    GROUP BY product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hint: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account).
SELECT (SUM(feb.quantity*feb.price)/COUNT(cus.acctnum)) AS avg_amt
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cus
    ON feb.orderID = cus.order_ID

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT avg(quantity)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
    ON feb.orderid=cust.order_id

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, SUM(price*quantity) AS revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product
    ORDER BY revenue DESC
    LIMIT 1;
